Project Overview
EasyVisa is a data-driven machine learning project designed to streamline the U.S. visa application process for foreign workers. 
The project addresses the increasing workload faced by the Office of Foreign Labor Certification (OFLC) by building predictive models to 
help identify which visa applications are more likely to be certified or denied. This supports U.S. employers and the government in efficiently managing the growing
number of applications and ensuring compliance with labor standards.

This project covers the following data science and machine learning topics:

Classification Modeling: Predicting binary outcomes (visa certified or denied) using supervised learning.
Feature Engineering: Handling categorical and numerical variables, encoding, and transforming features such as education, job experience, prevailing wage, and employment region.
Model Selection and Evaluation: Comparing multiple classification algorithms, including Decision Trees, Bagging, Random Forests, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, 
and Stacking. Evaluation metrics include Accuracy, Recall, Precision, and F1 Score.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Using techniques like GridSearchCV to optimize model performance.
Data Analysis: Exploring patterns in visa approvals/denials and identifying key drivers influencing case status.
Business Application: Providing actionable recommendations to facilitate visa processing and improve decision-making for both employers and regulators
